![Algo Compounder](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/380327833/bd402d80-d799-11eb-8d7c-62d5b740d9ab)

Compound your Algorand staking rewards by automatically sending yourself 0 Algo transactions.

## Getting Started

### Install Docker

#### Ubuntu

- Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

#### Mac

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).

#### Windows

- Install [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started).
- Install [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
  - Use [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71) as your distro.
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

### Install Algorand Sandbox

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algorand/sandbox.git
cd sandbox
./sandbox up mainnet
```

Notes:

- If you're on Windows, open Windows Terminal, select Ubuntu (from the dropdown arrow next to plus icon), and run `cd ~` first. If you clone the repo into the Windows filesystem under `/mnt`, you could run into filesystem issues.
- If you want to test Algorand Compounder on `testnet` first, replace `mainnet` with `testnet` above. Use the [Algorand Dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) to send yourself Algos on `testnet`. IMPORTANT: don't forget to switch back to `mainnet` when you're ready to send 0 Algo transactions to your main wallet. You'll need to reset the sandbox. Refer to the [Algorand Sandbox documentation](https://github.com/algorand/sandbox) for more information. Remember that `mainnet` holds Algos with real value and `testnet` does not.
- The Algorand Sandbox can take a while to set up. Wait 30 minutes and come back later. If the Algo Compounder script later reports that your receiving wallet holds no Algos (even after the set up process has finished), wait a while and try again.

### Install Algo Compounder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/randgoal/algo-compounder.git
cd algo-compounder
chmod +x algo-compounder.py
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Algo Compounder

There are two wallet addresses: the sender and the receiver. The sender is automatically generated by Algo Compounder. It will be sending 0 Algo transactions to the receiver. The receiver would normally be your main Algo wallet.

After you run Algo Compounder for the first time and your sender wallet address is generated, you need to fund the sender wallet. I recommend 1 Algo. With transactions currently costing 0.001 Algo, you should be able to send 1,000 0 Algo transactions with 1 Algo in the sender wallet.

Algo Compounder will generate a text file and a QR code for the sender wallet address in the script directory. I recommend scanning the QR code with the official [Algorand Wallet](https://algorandwallet.com/) app (you must run Algorand Sandbox in `mainnet` mode). It will also generate a `settings.json` file with your private key and passphrase. You should back this up. If you lose it, you will lose access to Algos in the sender wallet.

To run Algo Compounder:

```bash
./algo-compounder.py
```

You can verify your 0 Algo transaction went through at [Algo Explorer](https://algoexplorer.io/). Please note the network you're searching (`mainnet`, `testnet`) to the right of the blue search button.

If you're sending a 0 Algo transaction on mainnet, you should also get a notification on the [Algorand Wallet](https://algorandwallet.com/) app after about 5 seconds.

### How many times should you compound your Algo balance?

Depends on a few variables like your wallet balance and the staking rewards rate.

Edit and run `compounding-calculator.py` to find out.

Here are some common examples (as of June 2021):

| Algo Balance | Optimal Compounding Times |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 100 Algos    | 4 times per year          |
| 1,000 Algos  | 13 times per year         |
| 10,000 Algos | 42 times per year         |

### Scheduling Algo Compounder

Create a cron job:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add this line to run Algo Compounder every day at 12:00 pm:

```
0 12 * * * /home/yourname/algo-compounder/algo-compounder.py > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Replace `yourname` with your username. If you're not sure what your username is, run the `whoami` command.

Tips of any amount are greatly appreciated. Thank you!

### Disclaimer

Since Algo Compounder can involve cryptocurrency with real value, please don't run this script if you don't understand what it does. NEVER SEND MORE THAN 1 ALGO FROM YOUR MAINNET ALGORAND WALLET TO THE SENDER WALLET. If you lose your private keys or passphrases, send Algo to the wrong address, run Algorand Sandbox on the wrong network, or otherwise lose money, I cannot be held responsible.
